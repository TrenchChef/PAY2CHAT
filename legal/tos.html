    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> $(date)</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of PAY2CHAT, a peer-to-peer video chat application with crypto payments. By using PAY2CHAT, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Age Requirement (18+)</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use PAY2CHAT. By using this service, you certify that you are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 18.</p>

    <h2>2. Pure Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h2>
    <p>PAY2CHAT operates entirely as a peer-to-peer (P2P) application. All video calls, audio communication, file transfers, and payments occur directly between users' browsers. PAY2CHAT does not operate any servers, databases, or storage systems. We do not have access to, store, or intercept any communication between users.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of PAY2CHAT and all interactions with other users</li>
      <li>All transactions and payments made through the platform</li>
      <li>Content you share, transmit, or receive during video calls</li>
      <li>Files you purchase, send, or receive</li>
      <li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>
      <li>Security of your wallet and private keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Payment and Billing Terms</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Solana USDC Payments</h3>
    <p>PAY2CHAT uses Solana USDC for peer-to-peer payments. All payments occur directly between users' wallets on the Solana blockchain. We do not process, store, or have access to any payment information.</p>

    <h3>4.2 X402 Automatic Per-Minute Billing</h3>
    <p>The platform uses X402 protocol for automatic per-minute billing. Billing occurs every 60 seconds during active calls. By using PAY2CHAT, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Billing is automatic and requires no manual action</li>
      <li>Your wallet must have sufficient USDC balance for ongoing billing</li>
      <li>If a payment fails, the video call will be frozen and may be terminated after retry</li>
      <li>Transactions are irreversible once confirmed on the blockchain</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Upfront Prepayment</h3>
    <p>Invitees must prepay for the first 3 minutes of a call before the call can begin. This prepayment is non-refundable once the call starts.</p>

    <h2>5. No Refunds, No Reversal, No Custody</h2>
    <p>All payments made through PAY2CHAT are final and irreversible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> We do not process refunds. All transactions are direct P2P payments that cannot be reversed by PAY2CHAT.</li>
      <li><strong>No Reversal:</strong> Once a Solana transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, it cannot be reversed.</li>
      <li><strong>No Custody:</strong> PAY2CHAT does not hold, store, or have custody of any funds. All payments go directly from one user's wallet to another.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Content Responsibility and Prohibited Use</h2>

      <li>Malicious software or code</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 Content Responsibility</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for all content you share, transmit, or receive through PAY2CHAT. PAY2CHAT does not monitor, review, or filter content as all communication occurs directly P2P.</p>

    <h2>7. File Transfers</h2>
    <p>Files are transferred directly peer-to-peer over WebRTC DataChannel. PAY2CHAT does not store, inspect, or have access to any files transferred between users. You are responsible for:</p>

    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Warranties of merchantability</li>
      <li>Fitness for a particular purpose</li>
      <li>Non-infringement</li>
      <li>Availability, reliability, or uptime</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not guarantee that PAY2CHAT will be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <li>Content shared or received during calls</li>
      <li>Files purchased, transferred, or downloaded</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your sole remedy for any dissatisfaction with PAY2CHAT is to stop using the service.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PAY2CHAT and its operators from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from:</p>

    <p>Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of PAY2CHAT shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if no agreement can be reached, in New York, New York, USA.</p>
    <p>You waive your right to a jury trial and agree to resolve disputes through individual arbitration rather than class action lawsuits.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of PAY2CHAT after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to PAY2CHAT for any user who violates these Terms or engages in prohibited conduct. However, given the P2P nature of the platform, technical termination may not prevent continued use.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please review the Privacy Policy or contact us through the PAY2CHAT platform.</p>
